    <h1> Rachel Gulliver's Portfolio </h1>

<h4> <p>I have a black belt in karate.  However, it has been years since Ive actually practiced it so I'll be a little rusty.</p></h4>

<h6> <p>I am a college dropout.  I dropped out of college because I felt very stressed out and because I felt that I wasnt ready for college yet. Nonetheless, I have two years of college under my belt and I am proud of them.  I am here because I took a programming class in my final semester and I enjoyed it.</p> </h6>

 <h5><p>This is a portfolio project.  Speaking of portfolios, I would like to learn how to invest my money once I actually have money to invest.  Ive played games simulating the stock market and it was a lot harder than it seemed.</p></h5>
